# FIFO-Based-Data-Buffer-for-UART-Communication
This project implements a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffer module designed to support reliable UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) communication in digital systems. It helps manage asynchronous data transfer between devices by temporarily storing bytes received via UART before processing or forwarding.
